# GeoDo
An Android Mobile application. 
Lets the user add "Note's". 
Allows the User to tag a Note with a location, then uses geofences to alert the user if a geofence is crossed.
As a proof of concept it lets the user add imgaes to a note, uses a TensorFlow neural network to sugggest what that object is using the outline of the image.
